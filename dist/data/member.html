        <h2>Announcments 11/29/2016</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>- Talked about the 40 West and Lakewood. Brian brought large scale drawings, floor plans and 3-d renderings of the Pasternack building sent by Bill Marino. We discussed the options and for people in attendance on the tour of Pasternack a couple of weeks ago the same issues are apparent (being able to transform the space into a gallery and the cost). </li>
            <li>- Next gallery has already signed a lease agreement with Scott the owner and will moving into the large front area (high ceilings and entry to Colfax). This space is now off the table. We do not know any details about this agreement.</li>
            <li>- The descion was made, in order to approach Scott with an offer we needed to pick a specific location in the building that would meet our needs.
            - The only option would be directly behind the Pasternack store and offices that face Colfax in the main building. This is the most complete space that will require work from both Scott and us. As Laura stated if we consider this property we will need to negotiate a below $1 sq foot agreement.</li>
            <li>- Scott will pay for all utilities and security costs.</li>
            <li>- We can also cut in our own entry from the parking lot shared with Winchel's donuts.</li>
            <li>- I do believe we are all in agreement that most people do not want to move to Commerce city.</li>
            <li>- Phil said Jeanie King understands if we do not move to her location because of the timeline for construction has been delayed. They will break ground in January.</li>
            <li>- Bill Marino will activity continue to look for potential gallery spaces in Lakewood, but there is nothing at the moment.</li>
            <li>- Noah provided postcards for the Open Show. They are available at Pirate for distribution.</li>
            <li>- Bug is bringing beer for the Open Show.</li>
            <li>- Reminder, the Pirate group show opens December 16. We need to start thinking about  marketing this show and Noah who will provide the postcards. </li>
            <li>- Brian and I scheduled a meeting Thursday morning at 9:30am with Bill Marino to open the building up for us and to take measurements, images, and look at the feasibility of this area behind the Pasternack store.</li>
